## Overview

Welcome to the NEXT JOB Frontend repository! This project is the culmination of our efforts at a programming school in Malaysia, where we delved into both front-end and back-end development. Despite being labeled as a front-end project, it encapsulates the entire stack, offering a comprehensive job posting site.

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte:** Main front-end framework
- **pocketbase:** Open-source back-end
- **Front-end Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JS, Svelte, Node.js
- **Backend Technologies:** Node.js, Prisma, Docker

## Project Structure

- **src/:** Contains the source code for the Svelte front-end.
- **public/:** Stores static assets used in the front-end.

## Running the Frontend Locally

1. **Ensure you have Node.js installed.**
2. **Clone this repository:** `git clone [repository-url]`
3. **Navigate to the project folder:** `cd next-job-frontend`
4. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
5. **Run the development server:** `npm run dev`

## Connecting with the Backend

- The front-end communicates with the back-end through pocketbase using specified endpoints.
- Ensure the pocketbase server is running and configured properly.
